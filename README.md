In 2022, I made the decision to transition to the field of technology after completing my undergraduate degree in Business Administration (2019-2022). Technology has always been a passion in my life, from an early age, and it finally took center stage in my academic and professional journey.

My journey into technology began in February 2022 when I enrolled in the Computer Science undergraduate program. This transition marked a relentless pursuit of knowledge in a field that has always fascinated me. Throughout this journey, I have gained solid skills in programming, data analysis, and technological solutions. The opportunity to delve deeply into this universe has been enriching, and I am eager to continue growing as a technology professional.

During my experience in Administration, I developed fundamental skills that continue to be an asset in my career. I learned the art of organization, strategic planning, and effective management. Working under pressure and communicating clearly and effectively are skills I honed and believe to be valuable in any field.

I also possess strong skills in image and video editing. This competence adds a creative and artistic touch to my skill set, allowing me to create impactful and engaging visual content.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS / TYPESCRIPT / REACT
